There are many methods for integration, simpson's method is most widely used, 
so I just provide simpson's code. but introduce other mathods for integration.

#Note: If you integrate in polar or somespace with angle, remember to transform to degree to rad.

#Note: In scipy, it uses 1/3 rule for simpson, it just apply for odd number of point.
       For even, it uses trapezoid method, so the error is higher.
       
Try the script in testScipy
